# Student Performance Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing student exam scores in three subjects: **Math**, **Reading**, and **Writing**.  
The goal is to understand how different factors such as **gender**, **lunch type**, **parental education**, and **test preparation** affect student performance.

---

## What This Project Does

- Loads and explores a real dataset of student scores.
- Analyzes how different groups (e.g., boys vs. girls, standard vs. free lunch) perform.
- Uses visualizations to make patterns easier to understand.
- Summarizes key findings in a clear and simple way.

---

## Tools Used

- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- pandas (for handling data)
- seaborn & matplotlib (for graphs and plots)

---

## Visualizations Included

- **Box plots** to compare score distributions by gender and test prep
- **Bar plots** to show average scores across categories
- **Histograms** to see how scores are spread

---

## Key Insights

1. Girls performed better in reading and writing; boys did slightly better in math.
2. Students with standard lunch had higher average scores than those with free/reduced lunch.
3. Students who completed the test preparation course scored higher in all subjects.
4. Higher parental education level is generally linked to better student performance.
